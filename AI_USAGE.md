### **Accessibility Implementation**
```typescript
// Cursor AI-suggested ARIA attributes and keyboard support
<div
  role="button"
  aria-label="Upload image file by clicking or dragging and dropping"
  aria-describedby="upload-instructions"
  tabIndex={0}
  onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}

>
```

### **Error Handling Pattern**
```typescript
// Cursor AI-designed retry mechanism with exponential backoff
const retryWithBackoff = async (attempt: number = 1): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    await generateImage();
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt < MAX_RETRIES && error.message === 'Model overloaded') {
      const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000;
      setTimeout(() => retryWithBackoff(attempt + 1), delay);
    } else {
      throw error;
    }
  }
};
```

### **Component Testing**
```typescript
// Cursor AI-assisted test structure for accessibility
test('should have proper accessibility attributes', () => {
  render(<ImageUpload onImageSelect={mockOnImageSelect} />);
  
  const uploadArea = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /upload image file/i });
  expect(uploadArea).toHaveAttribute('aria-label');
  expect(uploadArea).toHaveAttribute('aria-describedby', 'upload-instructions');
  expect(uploadArea).toHaveAttribute('tabIndex', '0');
});
```

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Cursor AI-suggested state management pattern
const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState('');
const [selectedStyle, setSelectedStyle] = useState('editorial');
const [generatedImage, setGeneratedImage] = useState<GenerationResponse | null>(null);

const handleGenerationComplete = (generation: GenerationResponse) => {
  setGeneratedImage(generation);
  setToast({ message: 'Image generated successfully!', type: 'success' });
  
  // Clear form fields after successful generation
  setSelectedImage(null);
  setPrompt('');
  setSelectedStyle('editorial');
};
```
